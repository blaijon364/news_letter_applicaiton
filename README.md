The wireframes of the application can be found below.

1. The user should be able to switch between US and GB as country. Each news item is displayed as a card with title, image and description. 
By clicking “More”, the user can see a details view with the title, image and content of the news (country selection is disabled whenever the user looks at the details view).

2. Under the “Categories” tab, the user can see the top 5 news for certain categories the API supports (entertainment, general, health, science, sports, technology). 
These top news for each category are displayed in a single row with an > indicator if not all items are visible. By clicking on the < or > indicator, the news moves one position. The user can click on each news item to open the same details view mentioned above. Additionally, each category can be clicked, after which all the top news for that category are displayed. 

3. The search section contains an input field where a user can enter a term that he or she wants to search in top news. 
The page displays all news that meets the search criteria (country change is enabled). 

4. Application  should be responsive to work on smaller devices.
